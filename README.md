# FastShell

inspired by [FireShell](http://getfireshell.com)
Fiercely quick front-end boilerplate and workflows.

The opinionated FastShell framework. Built for the modern developer. For teams and the individual, encouraging a better workflow. JavaScript task running, build processes, autominification and file concatenation, wrapped with an enhanced HTML5 boilerplated framework.

## Project setup and Gulp installation
FastShell utilises open source components running on the Terminal/command-line for it's workflow, you'll need to install Node and Gulp. Here's a walkthrough of how to get a project up and running in minutes. Once Node and Gulp are installed all future projects running Gulp are instant.

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html) and [Git](http://git-scm.com) on your machine. If you're a Windows user you'll also need to install [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads).
2. [Install Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) using `npm install -g gulp`. You may need to use `sudo` in front of the Gulp install command to give it permissions. 
3. Fork/Clone/Download the FastShell repository into your machine, you should hopefully see all the files and folders.
4. Navigate to the `gulp-dev.command` file and double-click it. This will open the Terminal and install the necessary `node_modules` folder, which are FastShell's dependencies. The `gulp-dev.command` file includes a `sudo` prefix so you'll need to enter your password to install.
5. The `gulp-dev.command` should install all the dependencies, which you can check back to see in your folder, and then run the commands associated with FastShell, and automatically open a new FastShell project running on `localhost:9000`.
6. From now on, just double-click the `gulp-dev.command` file to automatically run FastShell's Gulp tasks, it's setup using the following script to automatically `cd` you into the correct directory and run the necessary commands:

````sh
cd "$(dirname "$0")"
if [ ! -d node_modules ];then
    sudo npm install
fi
gulp
````
